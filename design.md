# LOTR SDK Design Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the architectural and design decisions behind the `LOTR SDK`. This SDK provides an easy-to-use interface to interact with the Lord of the Rings API. Developers can fetch movie details, quotes, and other related data seamlessly.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `src/`
  - `modules/`
    - `movie.js`: Movie-related data operations
    - `quote.js`: Quote-related data operations
  - `utils/`
    - `request.js`: Utility for API requests
  - `lotr-sdk.js`: Combines Movie and Quote modules
  - `index.js`: Main entry point for SDK
- `tests/`
  - `movie.test.js`
  - `quote.test.js`
  - `request.test.js`
- `demo/`
  - `demo.js`: Demonstration for local testing
- `package.json`
- `README.md`

### Core Components

#### 1. **Movie Module (`movie.js`)**

This module defines the `Movie` class that exposes methods to fetch movie-related data, like fetching all movies, fetching details by movie ID, and so on.

#### 2. **Quote Module (`quote.js`)**

Similar to the Movie module, the `Quote` class in this module provides methods to retrieve quotes and related data.

#### 3. **Request Utility (`request.js`)**

This utility abstracts the process of making API requests using `axios`. It sets the necessary headers and handles API errors.

#### 4. **LOTR SDK (`lotr-sdk.js`)**

This file initializes instances of the `Movie` and `Quote` classes and is used in conjunction with `index.js` to provide them as part of the SDK's interface.

#### 5. **Index (`index.js`)**

The main entry point for the SDK when integrated into other applications. It exports the LOTRSDK class for external usage.

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: The SDK is designed with modularity in mind. Each module has a single responsibility, making the codebase maintainable and scalable.
2. **Error Handling**: Any errors during API requests are caught and appropriately handled, ensuring the SDK's stability.
3. **Extensibility**: New modules or utilities can be easily added without significant changes to existing code, thanks to the modular architecture.
4. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and a simple API make it easy for developers to integrate the SDK into their applications.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Introduce caching mechanisms to reduce repetitive API calls and enhance speed.
2. **Pagination Handling**: Provide utilities to easily navigate through paginated results from the API.

We encourage developers and contributors to provide feedback, enhancements, or report any issues to continually improve the SDK's design and functionality.
